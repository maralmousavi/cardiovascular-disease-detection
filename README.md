# Dataset description
[The cardiovascular disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) is an open-source dataset found on Kaggle. The dataset consists of 70,000 patient records and also contains 11 features.

Data description:
There are 3 types of input features:

Objective: factual information

Examination: results of medical examination

Subjective: information given by the patient

Features:

* Age | Objective Feature | age | int (days)
* Height | Objective Feature | height | int (cm) |
* Weight | Objective Feature | weight | float (kg) |
* Gender | Objective Feature | gender | categorical code |
* Systolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | ap_hi | int |
* Diastolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | ap_lo | int |
* Cholesterol | Examination Feature | cholesterol | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |
* Glucose | Examination Feature | gluc | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |
* Smoking | Subjective Feature | smoke | binary |
* Alcohol intake | Subjective Feature | alco | binary |
* Physical activity | Subjective Feature | active | binary |
* Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease | Target Variable | cardio | binary |

All of the dataset values were collected at the moment of medical examination.
